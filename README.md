This repositiory is forked from [Nikita repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind). You can read why he made the workflow [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/opening-up-my-mind-%EF%B8%8F-575c8ece8a24).

I was so impressed with what he did with this workflow. He can search through all things with really easy way. So I decided to fork this repo, and transfered
all I know to MindNode and search it with Alfred.

As this workflow is focused and optimised for fast access to all the knowledge and references I have indexed.

## Install
Cause I made this repository for personal purpose, so if you wanna make the same
